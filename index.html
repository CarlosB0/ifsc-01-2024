<h2>Dragon Project Revision and Reflection</h2>
    <p>In this assignment I ask that you collect feedback from a peer, family member, or a friend on your first attempt at the Dragon or Segway project. Using that feedback, I'd like you to attempt to address any issues or problems pointed out by your potential users. You should provide a link to the revised project duplicate the directory in aws and then add a link to the revised project (see above). You should also provide several paragraphs reflecting on the learning experience working on this project and your experience during the semester. What were the things you did well? What would you do differently if you had to startover? Also report on the feedback you received and what you did to address those issues or why you chose not to make the recommended changes. Some of things i struggled was putting the HTML and adding the jss for my dragon project. My learning experience was very interesting because I learned new things and also learned how to code better than my previos years doing this.
       Also I had a good relationship with my fellow classmates and they helped me as well with doing this project as well. They gave me feedback with as long side of parents and other family members. The things I did well was addings links to github and also making codespace right as well. I also did well was adding different background-color to my projects as well. Things I would do if I could startover is everything because I have a better understanding with different size texts and text colors. 
       The feedback I got was to make everything better and try new things to make my project more colorful. 
       
    


  <h3>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h3>
   <p>Progressive Enhancement is cruical in modern in develpoment as it prioritizes accessibility, inclusivity, and usuability for all users, regardless of their device, browser or network conditions. By adopting a progressive enhancement approach, developers start with a baseline of functionality that work across all devices and browsers, then enhance the experience for users with more advance features. One of the main benefit is progressive enhancement is resilience. It ensures that even if a person browers or device doesn't support the latest technologies or features, they can still access and interact with the basic content and functionality of a website or web application. This approach minimzes the risk of excluding users and enhances the overall reliability and accessibility of the web experience. Progressive enhancement promotes scalability and maintainability. By building websites and web applications in layers, developers can easily add new features or enhancement without jeopardizing the core functionality. This approach makes it simpler to adapt to evolving technologies, address compatibility issues,and maintain consistency across differnt platforms and devices.
